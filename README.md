## Pitch for SDP Event Management :tada:

Hi, we just have one question : Have your ever felt like a complete newcomer to an event you attended ? Never get that feeling again with *our app*. It features a real-time
broadcast feed from the organizers, interactive map and customizable schedule. In large events, we allow you to stay connected with your friends using geolocalization. *Our app* also offers an Organizer side to manage all these features within the app.
Finally no fears of missing out as *our app* connects you to a wide range of events you can discover, consult and bookmark within the app.
With *our app* the event will become **your** event.

We're working on a mobile application to support event management, helpful for both visitors and organizers. It features a real-time
broadcast feed from the organizers, interactive map and customizable schedule. In large events, we allow you to stay connected with your friends using geolocalization. *Our app* also offers an Organizer side to manage all these features within the app.
Finally no fears of missing out as *our app* connects you to a wide range of events you can discover, consult and bookmark within the app.
With *our app* the event will become **your** event.

*n.b : Please comment and review !* :+1: *wherever there is OUR APP written, this must be replaced by the app name.*
