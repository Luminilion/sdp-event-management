## Pitch for SDP Event Management :tada:

Hi, we just have one question : Have your ever felt like a complete newcomer to an event you attended ? Never get that feeling again with *our app*. *Our app* features a wide range of options starting with a nice map highlighting all the relevant spots, a newsfeed to stay updated, a schedule for every activity in the event, and even **your** schedule to not miss anything. *Our app* also helps you keeping int touch with your friends in the place and offers an Organizer side to manage all these features within the app.
Finally no fears of missing out as *our app* connects you to a wide range of events you can discover, consult and bookmark within the app.
With *our app* the event will become **your** event.

*n.b : Please comment and review !* :+1: *wherever there is OUR APP written, this must be replaced by the app name.*

New PR opened for modification and review.
