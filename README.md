# Gatsbi

## App Specification

Gatsbi is the perfect app to discover and attend events. It was designed to offer comfort and tranquillity to its users when they attend conventions or festivals. The motivation for this project comes from the complexity of organizing events as well as centralizing every information about them. To help attendees, the app centralizes schedules, locations, description, contact mean, feedback and news feed. In the meantime, authenticated organizers can manage everything visible to the attendees, as well as ticket scanning, global communication and event creation.
The objective is to enable managing the whole event through this app while centralizing everything there is to know about it.
